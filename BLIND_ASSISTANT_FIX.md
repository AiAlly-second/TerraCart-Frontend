# Fix: Second Page Voice Assistant

## Issue
The voice assistant button was unresponsive, and the page was crashing due to a missing CSS file.

## Fix
1.  **Created `SecondPage.css`** to resolve the 500 server error.
2.  **Restored `handleVoiceAssistant`** logic for full multi-language capabilities.

## Status
-   Blind Support: **Active** (English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati)
-   Navigation: **Visible** and Functional
